# MICS-shader-maker


[Download the plugin from here!](https://github.com/rikkarlo/MICS-shader-maker/releases/download/v1.7.0/MICS.shader.maker.1.7.0.zip)


This Blender plugin was developed to simplify importing texture maps created via RelightLAB.
It's aimed at non-expert users and professionals to simplify and speed up the validation of texture maps and the generation of a rendered preview of the material on a sample 3D cloth.
